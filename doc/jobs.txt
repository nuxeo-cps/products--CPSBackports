CPS JOBS Backport

.. contents::   :depth: 4

Quoting the documentation of the current CPSJob (TODO insert proper
link to ``doc.cps-cms.org``, fix CPSUtil first) :

 CPS jobs is a harness to launch python scripts ("jobs") against a CPS
 portal. The jobs can invoke any API from the Zope/CMF/CPS stack
 and run as registered users. It works either in monolithic or ZEO
 setups.

 For long-running scripts, it is highly preferable to external methods.

Usage
=====

The usage is exactly the same as in CPS >= 3.5.1 (TODO: link to documentation)

History
=======

CPS jobs appeared first in CPS 3.5.0, their API has changed in CPS
3.5.1. 

Available jobs

``CPSUtil/jobs/housekeeping.py``, that was first released with CPSUtil
